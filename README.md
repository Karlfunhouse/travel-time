#Travel Time

###Description

Travel Time is a hub to find somewhere new and book a trip to experience it first hand.  A traveler can log in to see all of their past, present & upcoming trips. They can also see how much they've spent on travel this year!

 An agent can log in to see who's traveling today, as well as how much money they've made helping people pursue their dreams.

 Learning goals for this project were:
  * object oriented programming for organization.
  * fetching and interacting data from an API.
  * create a testing suite to ensure functionality.
